# Improvements and some security points

Enhacements are always there in a product 

So in our use case we can improve and manage the security like:
	All the public access should be removed from the s3, lamda and sqs
	Strict policies and permisions are given to the roles only.
	For ex:
		We can give read only acces on the bucket and on lambda
		Also particular access or role is provided to lamda so that it can write messages to that particlar bucket only not on other.
		Can create all these things in a virtual private cloud (vpc), so that lambda and and buckets are not exposed to the world
		Security groups and subnets are used and associate ports are open on that security group like 
	for exp:
		we can set inbound and outbound rules on the security group 
		so that we can control and manages the traffic according to our need
		We can open only 443 ie https port only not http port
		
	
For Improvements part we can do following things:
we can use cloudwatch and set an alarms to that.
	So if anytime lamda fails due to any issue lamda triggers the logs to the cloudwatch and cloudwatch sends the
	Alarms to the partucluar concened person saying..hey something went wrong with appropriate error messages.
	
	we can collect logs of every event and message triggered
	This is can be further use for analysis part
	like we can do analysis:
		how and in what time interval lamda is triggered 
		
	Also s3 logs can be collected for futher enchanchements
	
	Also cost analysis can be done
	Like we can set up monitoring kind of things that can chekcs for the cost and for the traffic control parts through networks 
	and metrices that are already given.
